Hi,

Thank you for updating the {% site "name" %} information for {{ site.comment|safe }}.
Your changes have been approved and they are now visible at:
http://{% site "domain" %}{% url gcse.views.view site.id %}

Google takes several hours to several days to update the {% site "name" %} custom search engine with the new information.

Thanks again for helping the agility community.

Best regards,
Steve
