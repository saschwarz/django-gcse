Hi,

The {% site "name" %} information for {{ site.comment|safe }} has been updated.
You can see the updated entry at: http://{% site "domain" %}{% url cse.views.view site.id %}
If there are errors or omissions please correct them at: http://{% site "domain" %}{% url cse.views.edit site.id %}

Google takes several hours to several days to update the {% site "name" %} custom search engine with the new information.

Are you new to {% site "name" %}? Here's what it's about: http://{% site "domain" %}{% url 'about' %}
Here are the answers to some frequently asked questions:  http://{% site "domain" %}{% url 'faq' %}

{% if site.original_url %}Please consider adding a link to http://{% site "domain" %} to your website, we'd really appreciate it!{% endif %}

Best regards,
Steve
